# AI Food Calorie Scanner

A mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to scan and analyze food items, providing detailed nutritional information and calorie counts.

## Project Overview

The AI Food Calorie Scanner is designed to help users make informed dietary choices by providing instant nutritional information through image recognition technology. The app will identify food items in photos and return detailed nutritional data including calories, macronutrients, and serving size information.
